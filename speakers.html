    </h2>
    <a class="close" href="#close">&times;</a>
    <div class="content">
      <strong>Abstract : </strong> A community is a tightly-connected group of 
      nodes in a network. More formally, a community is a group of nodes or 
      vertices that have more edges connecting to each other within the group 
      than to vertices outside the group. Community detection is an important 
      problem in network analysis. Community detection can be used in analyzing 
      real-world complex systems and has applications in many areas such as 
      computer science, network science, physics, and computational biology. 
      Label propagation is a community detection method that is simpler and 
      faster compared to other methods like Louvain, InfoMap, and spectral 
      approaches. At the same time, it preserves the quality of detected 
      communities reasonably well. It is essential to balance both the quality 
      of the solution and the runtime performance. Some real-world networks can
      be very large and have billions of nodes and edges. Sequential algorithms
      might not be suitable to deal with such large graphs. In this talk, I will
      present our recent work on parallel community detection algorithms based on 
      the label propagation method. The algorithms designed for distributed-memory
      and hybrid parallel systems. I will discuss a few novel optimizations and 
      communication schemes that lead to very efficient and scalable algorithms. 
      Our parallel algorithms are efficient, scalable to thousands of cores, and 
      can process massive graphs. The hybrid algorithm can detect communities in a 
      large graph with 61 million nodes and 1.9 billion edges in under 125 seconds 
      using 4096 cores.

    <div class="content">
      <strong>Abstract : </strong> Decision making in participatory systems generally 
      exists in a state of conflict.  Human decision making involving natural systems
      is a critical example of this nature due to participants with conflicting goals
      attempting to pull the system in opposite and often undesirable directions. 
      We propose an Artificial Intelligence based approach for consensus decision making
      that is transparent, holistic and realistic in producing effective outcomes.  
      Specifically, it presents an advanced fuzzy cognitive map approach that captures 
      diverse stakeholder views and assembles them into a map of the whole system view. 
      The system map is modelled as a neural network to generate effective solutions 
      that satisfy stakeholder goals in way that they reflect inclusivity and comprehensive
      coverage of stakeholder views and bring the system into a potentially better state.  
      The approach is applied to decision making in a conflicting and challenging water situation.

      <strong>Title of the Talk: </strong>  A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting 
      the Multivariate Performance Phenotype

    </h2>
    <a class="close" href="#close">&times;</a>
    <div class="content">
      <strong>Abstract : </strong> Genotype-to-phenotype mapping requires rigorous measurement 
      of the entire multivariate organismal phenotype. However, phenotyping on a large scale 
      is not feasible for many kinds of traits, resulting in missing data that can also cause 
      problems for comparative analyses and the assessment of evolutionary trends across species.
      Measuring the multivariate performance phenotype is especially logistically challenging, 
      and our ability to predict several performance traits from a given morphology is 
      consequently poor. We developed a machine learning model to accurately estimate multivariate
      performance data from morphology alone by training it on a dataset containing performance 
      and morphology data from 68 lizard species. Our final, stacked model predicts missing 
      performance data accurately at the level of the individual from simple morphological 
      measures. This model performed exceptionally well, even for performance traits that were 
      missing values for >90% of the sampled individuals. Furthermore, incorporating phylogeny did 
      not improve model fit, indicating that the phenotypic data alone preserved sufficient 
      information to predict the performance based on morphological information. This approach can
      both significantly increase our understanding of performance evolution and act as a bridge 
      to incorporate performance into future work on phenomics.

    </h2>
    <a class="close" href="#close">&times;</a>
    <div class="content">
      <strong>Abstract : </strong> Software reliability growth models (SRGM) assist in software release decisions
       by quantifying metrics based on failure data collected during testing. Complexity of SRGM can increase 
       significantly with increasing complexity of software, thus requiring faster and stable algorithms to 
       identify model parameters. While previous studies have attempted to address this issue through application 
       of machine learning (ML) algorithms, lack of sufficient data to train ML models. Moreover, it is important 
       to assess software in an online manner as data becomes available, which is difficult since limited data 
       is available towards the beginning of testing.
      Incremental learning provides the possibility of applying machine learning algorithms in an online manner, 
      however lack of large data towards the beginning of testing limits the efficiency. Therefore, this paper 
      proposes an adaptive incremental learning that utilizes a model trained on historical data which can 
      forecast failures for the present data. Historical data is selected based on the Granger causality 
      test. Our results indicate that the adaptive incremental learning approach achieves significantly 
      better accuracy on smaller sample sizes compared to simple application of neural networks.

      <strong>Abstract : </strong> Computer Music presents interesting programming challenges. 
      Rapid prototyping and end-user programming are essential since every composer/performer/developer 
      has different artistic objectives. Musicians and artists also demand high functionality, quality, 
      reliability, and real-time performance. An increasingly practical solution is to combine various 
      applications for sensing, control, sound synthesis, visualization and audio processing. To 
      facilitate coordination and control of multiple applications, a new framework, O2, has been 
      developed, featuring discovery, clock synchronization, and timed message passing. This talk 
      will focus on how O2 is used to facilitate music software development and much more.

    <div class="content">
      <strong>Abstract : </strong>Neural networks have gone through several waves of innovation 
      from the McCulloch/Pitts neuron of the 1940s and the Rosenblatt Perceptron in the 1960s 
      to the MLP and related developments of the 1990s and the Deep Learning CNN and LSTM models 
      of the last decade. Most recently, we have the transformer architectures and generative AI 
      models that are at the heart of the ChatGPT phenomenon. At all stages of their development 
      there has been a great deal of hype about neural networks and exaggerated expectations of their 
      capabilities which resulted in two so-called AI winters. In this talk I will explore one such 
      perhaps exaggerated claim - that ‘neural networks can predict the future’ - through the lens of 
      my personal experience of conducting research over 25 years on using neural networks to develop 
      predictive models for applications ranging from predicting final product quality on a manufacturing 
      production line to anticipating human motion and actions for seamless collaborative robotics.

      neurologists for diagnosis. This research implements a convolutional 
      neural network-based variational autoencoder model, modified with an 
      additional flattening layer, on four different scenarios. In the first 
      scenario, the model was trained on the BraTS-2019 dataset with a batch 
      size of 1 over 10 epochs, and then tested on the BraTS-2018 dataset. In 
      the second scenario, the model was trained on the BraTS-2018 dataset with 
      a batch size of 1 over 10 epochs, and then tested on the BraTS-2019 dataset. 
      In the third scenario, the model was trained on the BraTS-2019 dataset with 
      a batch size of 2 over 20 epochs, and then tested on the BraTS-2018 dataset. 
      In the fourth scenario, the model was trained on the BraTS-2018 dataset with 
      a batch size of 2 over 20 epochs, and then tested on the BraTS-2019 dataset. 
      The average Dice coefficient values of the whole tumor segmentation were 
      0.89003, 0.88551, 0.88569, and 0.9089, for the four scenarios, respectively. 
      This proposed method’s accuracy on average was 0.893, which was a higher 
      accuracy for whole tumor segmentation than other brain tumor segmentation 
      methods compared in this work.

    <div class="content">
      <strong>Abstract : </strong>OLAP and BI have conquered the scene of 
      decision-making systems research for decades, thus defining a wide 
      collection of models, techniques and algorithms whose main goal is
       that of effectively and efficiently representing, querying and mining 
       massive OLAP data cubes. With the advent of the modern big data era, 
       big OLAP data cubes arise, thus posing novel challenges to be faced-off 
       by the research community. Big OLAP data cubes are mainly processed over Clouds, 
       due to tight high-performance computing requirements, thus opening the door to a 
       large number of big data processing platforms, from both the academic and industrial world. 
       In the so-delineated context, the main research challenges again consist of the following 
       issues: (i) effectively and efficiently representing big OLAP data cubes over Cloud 
       architectures; (ii) effectively and efficiently querying big OLAP data cubes over Cloud 
       architectures; (iii) effectively and efficiently mining big OLAP data cubes over Cloud 
       architectures. This talk will discuss these issues, provide overview on state-of-the-art

          <strong>Abstract : </strong>One of the strengths of metaheuristics
          such as evolutionary algorithms and tabu search is that they are
          general ideas that can rather easily be applied to a new optimization
          problem at hand. In many cases, however, a straightforward
          implementation of a metaheuristic to an optimization problem does not
          reach state-of-the-art performance. Therefore, researchers often equip
          their metaheuristic with problem-specific bits and pieces that might
          be rather complicated to code. On the other side, the application and
          implementation of high-performance Operations Research (OR) techniques
          for optimization are often not achievable for non-experts. In other
          words, especially in industry, there is a need for high-performance
          optimization techniques that can be easily implemented by non-experts.
          In this talk we are going to explain that "Construct, Merge, Solve &
          Adapt (CMSA)", a new but simple algorithm combining heuristic elements
          with OR expertise, can fill this gap.

          <strong>Abstract : </strong>Artificial Intelligence revived in the last decade. The need for progress, the growing processing capacity and the low cost of the Cloud have facilitated the development of new, powerful algorithms. The efficiency of these algorithms in Big Data processing, Deep Learning and Convolutional Networks is transforming the way we work and is opening new horizons. Thanks to them, we can now analyse data and obtain unimaginable solutions to today’s problems. Nevertheless, our success is not entirely based on algorithms, it also comes from our ability to follow our “gut” when choosing the best combination of algorithms for an intelligent artefact. It's about approaching engineering with a lot of knowledge and tact. This involves the use of both connectionist and symbolic systems, and of having a full understanding of the algorithms used.  Moreover, to address today’s problems we must work with both historical and real-time data. We must fully comprehend the problem, its time evolution, as well as the relevance and implications of each piece of data, etc. It is also important to consider development time, costs and the ability to create systems that will interact with their environment, will connect with the objects that surround them and will manage the data they obtain in a reliable manner. <br>

          In this keynote, the evolution of intelligent computer systems will be examined. The need for human capital will be emphasised, as well as the need to follow one’s “gut instinct” in problem-solving. We will look at the benefits of combining information and knowledge to solve complex problems and will examine how knowledge engineering facilitates the integration of different algorithms. Furthermore, we will analyse the importance of complementary technologies such as IoT and Blockchain in the development of intelligent systems.  It will be shown how tools like "Deep Intelligence" make it possible to create computer systems efficiently and effectively. "Smart" infrastructures need to incorporate all added-value resources so they can offer useful services to the society, while reducing costs, ensuring reliability and improving the quality of life of the citizens. The combination of AI with IoT and with blockchain offers a world of possibilities and opportunities. <br>
          
          The use of edge platforms or fog computing helps increase efficiency, reduce network latency, improve security and bring intelligence to the edge of the network; close to the sensors, users and to the medium used. These and other relevant technologies that are transforming our ways to use AI will be discussed along the key note.

Transformers and big(ger) data trained models such as AudioLM also led to substantial change in this landscape, including major leaps forward in performance. This talk aims to briefly summarise the state-of-play when it comes to computers and today’s deep learning-based audio processing. Further to that, it will discuss where the road is likely to take us next. This includes rich state and trait attribution to general audio – both, for analysis of audio or generation of such. Speech processing was the beginning with today’s AI being able to “hear” someone’s age, height, emotion, or heart rate from the voice. It can also increasingly generate these aspects in a voice. Sound is coming up next, such as “produce the sound of smartphone with a broken display vibrating on an oak table on which there is also a half-filled glass”.

        much larger network. This research has a wide spectrum of real-world
        applications of developing powerful but light-weight and resource-limited
        front end devices. In the existing literature, typically the student
        always underperforms the teacher after knowledge distillation and this is

          <strong>Abstract : </strong>There is a need to develop mechanisms that allow opportunistic collaboration among services without requiring tight standards and also should not do extensive changes to the cloud service delivery model.

          From a market perspective, it is unlikely that multiple CSPs will agree on an easy and standardized way to access services in collaboration, as this would give clients total freedom to switch to other providers services, it also brings open and direct competition with other providers. CSPs often offer differentiated services with specialized proprietary products and services.
          
          We can overcome these restrictions by using network of proxies. A proxy is an edge-node-hosted software instance that a client or a CSP can delegate to carry out operations on its behalf. To facilitate dynamic collaboration between clouds, I would like to discuss a framework that uses proxies to act as mediators between multiple clouds that can share data.

          <strong>Abstract : </strong>The ethical, social, and legal landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven systems is rapidly changing. Since the General Data Protection Regulation (2018), stakeholders developing AI systems have faced numerous challenges in the interpretation and implementation of Article 22, specifically concerning an individual’s rights in the context of automated decision making, the ability of AI to explain decisions, explanation of the logic involved, and to develop models using only “correct” data. This has and is causing major challenges due to the lack of legal guidance, case law and ethical principles about the use of AI in different contexts.
           In 2023, the passing of the EU AI Act and other Global “AI and Digital” legalisation promises to also be a big disrupter to all stakeholders working in the field as adopting a risk-based approach to AI becomes the norm.
            In this talk I will briefly overview ethical issues and relevant legalisation related to AI and data driven technologies that are arising due to the increasing use of AI and whether consumers /audiences/ citizens are aware to these developments.
             Responsible innovation and ethical tech are essential to build public trust, yet how can businesses and researchers in academia harness People Power through community ideation and involvement and people’s panels? In this talk I will give some examples of bridging the gap between businesses, academia, and people and how the use of ethical toolkits such as consequence scanning can help to build citizen confidence and have impact potential.

          <strong>Abstract : </strong>In recent years, mobile devices can be equipped with increasingly advanced computing capabilities, which opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications. 
          Traditionally, any cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approach requires that data be centralized on a cloud-based server/data center. However, this can result in critical
          issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency as well as major security and privacy concerns. However, conventional ML technologies still require 
          personal data to be shared. Recently, in light of increasing security and privacy concerns,  the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use 
          their local data to train a local ML model required by the server. In a large, complex mobile edge networks, FL still faces implementation challenges with regard to communicational  
          costs, resource allocation, security, and privacy. In this talk, we begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of FL. We then discuss how FL can work to try and preserve
